    "The finding of adequate hyper parameters is crucial to improve the performance and generalization of machine learning models. There are several methods described in modern literature that can help to find the best fitting hyper parameters. The performance is tested in different dataset that are tested and well studied, such as MINST. Hyper parameters (HP) are external to the learning process but significantly impact model performance. HP are external to the learning process but significantly impact model performance. Effective tuning typically requires domain expertise or computationally expensive methods like brute-force search.\n",
    "Effective tuning typically requires domain expertise or computationally expensive methods like brute-force search In [1, 2, 3], the Bayesian optimization is explored.  Bayesian optimization leverages prior knowledge to update posterior distributions based on sample data, guiding the search for optimal hyperparameter configurations efficiently. Traditional approaches like grid search and random search are computationally expensive and less effective in high-dimensional spaces. Bayesian optimization offers a more efficient alternative, particularly for expensive, black-box objective functions. \n",
    "In [1] the use of Bayesian optimization is explored for tuning hyper parameters in machine learning models, which is critical for improving model performance. The study proposes a method using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes. Traditional approaches like grid search and random search are computationally expensive and less effective in high-dimensional spaces. Bayesian optimization offers a more efficient alternative, particularly for expensive, black-box objective functions. The results were conducted on machine learning models like random forests, neural networks (CNN and RNN), and deep forests (gcForest). Bayesian optimization demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.The results confirm that Bayesian optimization outperforms other optimization techniques in terms of speed and achieving better model performance, especially in scenarios with limited computational resources or high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces.\n",

    "Random Search, a method where hyper parameters are sampled randomly from predefined distributions. It is efficient for simple problems but struggles with complex models like DBNs. In order to improve this disadvantage, the Sequential Model-Based Optimization is introduced.\n",
